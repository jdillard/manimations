# Law of Complexity-Consciousness Animation

A beautiful Manim animation visualizing Teilhard de Chardin's **Law of Complexity-Consciousness**, showing the evolutionary journey from elementary particles to planetary consciousness.

## About

This animation illustrates the philosophical principle proposed by Pierre Teilhard de Chardin that **as material complexity increases, consciousness increases in parallel**. The visualization follows five major evolutionary stages, each marked on an exponential curve representing this fundamental relationship.

## The Five Stages

### 1. **Atoms** (Blue)
Elementary particles organize into stable atomic structures with electrons orbiting nuclei. The first emergence of ordered complexity from fundamental particles.

### 2. **Molecules** (Purple)
Atoms bond together to form complex molecular structures, culminating in the DNA double helix—the building blocks of life itself.

### 3. **Cells** (Orange)
Molecules organize into living cells complete with membranes, nuclei, mitochondria, and other organelles. The cell membrane pulses with life, demonstrating metabolism and homeostasis.

### 4. **Organisms** (Red)
Cells unite to form multicellular organisms with nervous systems. Neural networks light up showing the emergence of conscious awareness through interconnected neurons.

### 5. **Noosphere** (Gold)
The pinnacle of complexity-consciousness: humanity forms a planetary sphere of collective thought and consciousness. Minds connect around Earth in a glowing network representing global human interconnection.

## About Teilhard de Chardin

Pierre Teilhard de Chardin (1881-1955) was a French Jesuit priest, paleontologist, and philosopher who proposed that evolution is not merely biological but also spiritual and cosmic. His **Law of Complexity-Consciousness** suggests that:

> "The more complex a system becomes in its material organization, the more conscious it becomes."

The **Noosphere** (from Greek *nous* meaning "mind") is his concept of a planetary "sphere of human thought" emerging from the biosphere through human collective intelligence and interconnection.
